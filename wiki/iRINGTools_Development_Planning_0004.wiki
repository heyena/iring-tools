==Part8 & Mapping==

 * Simple statement
{{{
subject predicate object
}}}

 * Template statement
{{{
template
  role    object
  role    object
  role    object
}}}

===Purchase example===
<pre>Purchase
	 seller  <#Steve>
	 buyer   <#Rob>
	 price   "499.00"^^xsd:float
	 item    <#iPad>
	 store   <#BethesdaAppleStore></pre>

===Line Tag Template Definition===
(not really how definitions are expressed)
<pre><#LineTagTemplate>
	 object             <rdl:Line>
	 identifier         <xsd:String>
	 identificationType <rdl:LineTag></pre>

===Line Tag Template Instance===
<pre><#T00001>
	 type	        <tpl:LineTagTemplate>
	 object             <#AB-0001>
	 identifier         "12345-AB-0001"^^xsd:String
	 identificationType <rdl:LineTag></pre>
 * The result of the mapping is a Template Instance
 * *object* is the ClassRole because it points to the class the template is "on".
 * *identifier* is a PropertyRole because a property from the DataObject is mapped to it.
 * *identificationType* is a "Fixed" role.  In this case it is a ReferenceRole.

another case would be in a specialized template where the Role has a ValueQualfication.
<pre>     cardinality        "1"^^xsd:Integer</pre>
  * *cardinality* is also a "Fixed" role, but it is a ValueRole.

|| -- || When clicking on Mapping Labels are not resolved. || ?? || ?? ||
|| -- || Key Values are wrong in properties for Mapping, Class Name -> Graph Name, Class Id   -> Class Name (label should be resolved - see above). || ?? || ?? ||
|| -- || Class Role was not identified - supcherclass list should help - need to use it. || ?? || ?? ||
|| -- || When mapping ranges that are not XmlSchema, the selection from the search needs to be used. || ?? || ?? ||
