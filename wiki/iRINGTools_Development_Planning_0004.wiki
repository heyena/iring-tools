==Part8 & Mapping==

 * Simple statement
{{{
subject predicate object
}}}

 * Template statement
{{{
template
  role    object
  role    object
  role    object
}}}

 * Purchase example
{{{
Purchase
  seller  <#Steve>
  buyer   <#Rob>
  price   "499.00"^^xsd:float
  item    <#iPad>
  store   <#BethesdaAppleStore>
}}}

 * Line Tag Template Definition (not really how definitions are expressed)
{{{
<#LineTagTemplate>
  object             <rdl:Line>
  identifier         <xsd:String>
  identificationType <rdl:LineTag>
}}}

 * Line Tag Template Instance
{{{
<#T00001>
  type	             <tpl:LineTagTemplate>
  object             <#AB-0001>
  identifier         "12345-AB-0001"^^xsd:String
  identificationType <rdl:LineTag>
}}}
  * The result of the mapping is a Template Instance
  * *object* is the ClassRole because it points to the class the template is "on".
  * *identifier* is a PropertyRole because a property from the DataObject is mapped to it.
  * *identificationType* is a "Fixed" role.  In this case it is a ReferenceRole.

 * Another case would be in a specialized template where the Role has a ValueQualfication.
{{{
  cardinality        "1"^^xsd:Integer
}}}
   * *cardinality* is also a "Fixed" role, but it is a ValueRole.
